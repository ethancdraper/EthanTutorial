# EthanTutorial
A tutorial I'm trying to make for myself. I think writing myself some sort of tutorial to go about this work will be beneficial, so this is what I have so far.

* Step One: Create New Repository in GitHub Desktop
* Step Two: Publish repository in GitHub Desktop
* Step Three: Click 'Open in Atom' (#AtomSuperiority and #WeHateVI) 
* Step Four: In the 'path for new file' (in Atom), write your file name and extension (ex. Tutorial123.sh)
* Step Five: Type in commands and save (ex. date, cal, pwd, ls)
* Step Six: Open terminal
* Step Seven: Type: chmod +x Tutorial123.sh
* Step Eight: Type: ./Tutorial123.sh

This is according to: https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial-for-beginners. My problem is that I cannot get Step Seven or Step Eight to work. I am always either told that the file or directory does not exist, or that my permission is denied.

If permission is denied:

* Step One: Type: sudo chmod +x Tutorial123.sh
* Step Two: Put in your computer password (reminder: it will not show up on the monitor)
